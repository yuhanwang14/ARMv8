\section{Part III Implementation Strategies}

Yuhan Wang (yw8123) and Lei Ye (ky723) focused on Part I, which involves the emulator. Henry Wu (hw2823) and Bingshi Xu (bx223) concentrated on Part II, which pertains to the assembler.
For Part I, Yuhan Wang primarily handled the implementation of single data transfer and load from literal instructions. Lei Ye primarily dealt with data processing and branch instructions.
For Part II, Henry Wu focused on implementing the two-pass
