\section{Testing Our Implementation}

Yuhan Wang (yw8123) and Lei Ye (ky723) focused on Part I, which involves the emulator. Henry Wu (hw2823) and Bingshi Xu (bx223) concentrated on Part II, which pertains to the assembler.
For Part I, Yuhan Wang primarily handled the implementation of single data transfer and load from literal instructions. Lei Ye primarily dealt with data processing and branch instructions.
For Part II, Henry Wu focused on implementing the two-pass

\subsection{Yuhan Wang}
Collaborating with my group members on our project was a highly rewarding 
experience. I primarily focused on developing the emulator for Part 1 and 
writing the Checkpoint report. At first, I found it challenging to get 
comfortable with Git operations and version control, but mastering these 
skills proved crucial for effective teamwork. I particularly enjoyed solving 
technical issues, such as sign extension and converting word-indexed memory 
to byte-indexed memory. Overcoming these challenges gave me a great sense of 
satisfaction. Overall, programming as part of a team was both valuable and 
enriching for my personal and professional growth.
