# AArch64 Assembler & Emulator  

This project implements an **AArch64 assembler and emulator** for **ARMv8-A** architecture, developed for Raspberry Pi 3B.  

- **Emulator:** Simulates execution of AArch64 binary files, supporting general-purpose registers, instruction decoding, and pipeline execution.  
- **Assembler:** Translates A64 assembly code into binary, implementing a two-pass approach for label resolution.  
- **GPIO Interaction:** Includes an assembly program to flash an LED via Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO pins.  

This project enhances understanding of **low-level machine operations** and **instruction set architectures**, tested via a provided suite.
